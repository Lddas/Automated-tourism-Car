# DeloreAI Tourism-Car 

Welcome to the DeloreAI repository ! DeloreAI is a first implementation of a project developped in 24h in the context of the 2024 Infosys BIZHACKATHON in Bangalore.
The name of the project is a reference to the classic movie "Back to the future", in which they are driving the futuristic Delorean car. Here, you will find a first implementation of the project. 
Let's implement an autonomous tourism tour car ! This code is implemented as an @app. It detects dynamically (checks every 5sec) the car position 
thanks to the html file.
Then, it compares the localisation to the implemented Points of Interest (POI). Here, we implememented some of the campus musts, like the Washing Machine building.
All the POIs are implemented in a SQLite database. 

If you want to try it, run app.py, and copy the link "http://127.0.0.1:5000" on your browser, for it to find your localisation.

# Tourism-Car 

Let's implement an autonomous tourism tour car ! This code is implemented as an @app. It detects dynamically (checks every 5sec) the car position 
thanks to the html file.
Then, it compares the localisation to the implemented Points of Interest (POI). Here, we implememented some of the campus musts, like the Washing Machine building.
All the POIs are implemented in a SQLite database.
